This project demonstrates Stochastic Variational Inference in the TrueSkill Model, using Bayesian inference in large models with continuous latent variables and stochastic variational inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo on tennis data sets.

## Implementations include:
* `Project.toml` packages for the Julia environment.
* `autograd_starter.py` Python with autograd.
* `tennis_data.mat` dataset containing outcomes of tennis games.
* `src.jl` source code in Julia
* **`Julia-True-Skill-Model-Using-Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo-Final.ipynb`** the jupyter notebook

Note: this project is part of of the assignment from Statistical Methods for Machine Learning II at the Univeristy of Toronto.
